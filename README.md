# myLisp


I love programming languages. They are so much fun to work and play with.
myLisp is my first attempt at making my own programming language.

## The future of myLisp

myLisp has been shelved for now.

This was a good learning experience, but there is no practical use for this project.

## Language features that myLisp has
### Variable assignment

```
(define a 1)
```

### Built in functions

```
(+ 1 1)
```

### User functions

```
(lambda (b) (+ b b) )
```

### Function assignment

```
(define c (lambda (b) (+ b b) ))
```

### Conditionals

```
(if (+ -1 1) 'a 'b)
```
