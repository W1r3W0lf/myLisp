# myLisp

I am attempting to write a small lisp.

## Language features I plan to add
- Variable assignment
- Ability to define functions
- Conditionals
- Printing

## Features I might add after I'm done with the needs.
- Support for Real numbers

## Misc

I named this project myLisp 1) because I am bad at naming things and 2) This project is purely for learning so a bad name doesn't matter.

Later on I might try and turn this project into an R7RS-small interpreter, but that will be a different project with a different name.
