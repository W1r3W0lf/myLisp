# myLisp

I am using this project to learn how to write an interpreter.
This is my first attempt at writing a real programming language, so it will probably take me a while to figure out.
I'm basing this off of what I know about Scheme and other lisps.

## Language features I plan to add, in order of priority
- [X] Variable assignment
- [X] Built in functions
- [ ] User functions
- [ ] Function assignment
- [ ] Conditionals
